        <p>
          I am a 3rd-year BTech student in Electronics & Computer Science at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai obsessed with building intelligent, beautiful, and lightning-fast applications that solve real problems. My sweet spot is where Artificial Intelligence meets elegant mobile & web experiences, especially with Flutter and modern ML frameworks.

          Right now, I am deep into Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch), Frontend development (Html, CSS, Bootstrap, TailWindCSS and React+Vite), and shipping production-ready apps. I have led the technical team at IEEE-VIT, built an institutional faculty evaluation system under our Principal’s mentorship, and I am currently working on AI-powered projects while preparing research papers. I also create content and mentor juniors whenever I get the chance.

          In my free time, you will find me trekking in the Kalsubai peak at 5 AM to catch the sunrise, geeking out over the latest Laptops and smartphone specs and camera benchmarks, planning my next solo backpacking trip, or debugging code at 2 AM with a strong filter coffee. These mountains taught me resilience the same grit that helps me push through tough bugs and ship features that matter.

          Actively looking for AI/ML or Flutter internships (Dec 2025 – Jun 2026) and open to research collaborations. Germany 2027 for Masters is the long-term target. Let’s connect if you're building something cool. I would love to contribute and grow together.
